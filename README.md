# functional-programming-basics
this repository is a collection of small, relatively basic problems solved using OCaml

### libraries & technologies:
`ocaml`

as well as a relatively brief summary of the material explained on te theoretical versions

### p01 - types and basic expressions
the expected result of introducing the statements given on the ocaml compilator are written, and some expressions have to be made
### p02 - simple functions and i/o
implementation of three functions: one that calculates pi, other that gives the value of euler's number and 
### p03 - conditionals
implementation of functions related to primes (next prime, last prime, is_prime...), one that calculates the nth iteration of the fibonacci sequence
as well as a set of instructions to be written using Î·-reduction and another to write the expected result if compiled
### p04 - functions
implementation of a function that returns the greatest common divisor of two given integers and a set of functions that return the power of a number by another
### p05 - functions in sets
implementation of a set of functions that: 
- given an integer it will apply a function repeatedly until the result collapses to 1
- a function that returns the highest number of the resulting list
- a function that returns the total number of elements in that list
### p06 - lists
implementation of some of the most common functions on the list module
### p07 - lists (tail-recursive)
the last implementations must be tail-recursive
### p08 - currying
(unfinished) implementation of a function that currifies a given function and its inverse, and do the same for composite functions
### p09 - tail recursion
implementation of the tail-recursive version of the given functions
### p10 - sorting
implementation and analysis of some given sorting algorithms
### p11 - knight's tour
implementation of the knight's tour problem
### p12 - trees 
implementation of functions related to binary and general trees
### p13 - logic
(unfinished) implementation of a function that checks the boolean value of a logical proposition and a converter of two different implementations
